# Fun-With-Dimensions
A cuboid is a three-dimensional shape with a length, width, and a height. The program you are given takes takes those dimensions as inputs, defines Cuboid struct and creates its object. Complete the program by creating a constructor, which will take the length, the width, and the height as parameters and assign them to its struct members. Also complete Volume() and Perimeter() methods inside the struct, to calculate and return them, so that the given methods calls work correctly.
